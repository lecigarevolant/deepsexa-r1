## üéØ What is Deepsexa?

Deepsexa is a free and open-source chat app that uses Exa's API for web search and (Deepseek) R1 1776 LLM for reasoning.

<br>

## What is R1-1776? 

[Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/open-sourcing-r1-1776) have open-sourced r1-1776, which is simply deepseek-r1 with the CCP censorship scrubbed out. Not only is this much more palatable in itself, at time of creation they offer the most reliable API that is serving R1 of any kind. 

[Exa](https://exa.ai) are killing it and I couldn't live without the original so I forked, swapped in r1-1776, and gave it a silly name. Definitely would like to build upon the combo, so stay tuned or beat me to it! 

For now this app provides a cool and simple chat experience which you can clone and build upon.
